Project Overview

The Property Data Scraper automates the extraction of real estate data from various online sources, significantly reducing the time required for manual data collection. 
This tool enables comprehensive data analysis by aggregating large datasets and supports predictive modeling projects by ensuring data accuracy and reliability through a robust data pipeline.


Features

•	Automated Data Extraction: Streamlines the collection process by automatically scraping property data,
which drastically cuts down on manual data collection time.
•	Comprehensive Data Aggregation: Gathers extensive datasets from a multitude of real estate websites to support deep analytical tasks.
•	Robust Data Pipeline: Maintains high data integrity that ensures accurate and reliable data for subsequent analysis and modeling.
•	Support for Dynamic Content: Capable of handling JavaScript-heavy pages and dynamic content to access and extract real-time property data.
•	Data Parsing and Storage: Efficiently parses HTML/CSS and stores the extracted data in structured formats like CSV and JSON, ready for further analysis.


Included Notebooks

•	model_build.ipynb: This notebook outlines the steps taken to build and refine predictive models using the scraped data.
•	web_scrapping.ipynb: Demonstrates the Python scripts developed for scraping static and dynamic content from targeted real estate websites.
•	EDA_relationship_analysis.ipynb: Contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) that examines relationships within the data, helping to validate the quality and comprehensiveness of the collected datasets.
